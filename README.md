# docker-obs-ndi-ng
Dockerized OBS + NDI plugin Next Generation

Based on the old style container before the latest rebase from 
https://github.com/patrickstigler/docker-obs-ndi
and https://github.com/Z0ink5/obs-ndi-docker which uses the old image format. 

For now the newer style image based on the accetto image is not working correctly without major after build modifications. 

A working version of the legacy image is posted to the legacy branch.
